# GradientLab

GradientLab is a gradient picker made with together with React and [mobx-state-tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree). Some fancy animations with the help of [pose](https://popmotion.io/pose/) are thrown in as well.

Please note this is currently work in progress, and far from a final version.

At hthe moment, it focuses on LAB and LCH color spaces for interpolation, as they generally look the best to us aesthetically. See the following article for a bit more information:\
